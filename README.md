# Composer Testing

I love composer and built a package with this  **[howto](https://www.w3resource.com/php/composer/create-publish-and-use-your-first-composer-package.php)**.


```
…or create a new repository on the command line

echo "# hello-composer-stbr" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/bstaub/hello-composer-stbr.git
git push -u origin main

…or push an existing repository from the command line

git remote add origin https://github.com/bstaub/hello-composer-stbr.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

```
